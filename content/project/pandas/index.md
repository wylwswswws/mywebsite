summary: |
  - Developed and implemented traffic flow models, including cellular automata, car-following models, and partial differential equations (PDE), to simulate realistic traffic dynamics across various densities and driver behaviors.
  - Conducted extensive simulations to assess the impact of different traffic densities and road conditions, optimizing model parameters for enhanced predictive accuracy.
  - Analyzed and identified optimal density levels and behavioral factors that aligned closely with real-world traffic patterns, providing recommendations to improve flow and reduce congestion.
